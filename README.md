# Tic Tac Toe - Client

This is a ready-to-use client implementation for playing Tic Tac Toe on ai-arena.de.

## How to connect
To be able to connect you need to obtain a token from the Game Hub and use it as a value for 'token' in the class YourGameLogic.

## Apply your own game logic
The function nextAction() in YourGameLogic currently takes the first slot which is available. You can implement your
logic by replacing the content of this function.
